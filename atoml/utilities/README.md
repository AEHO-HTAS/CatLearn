## Cost function
[(Back to top)](#utilities)

The implementation of the cost function to return some standard data on the
errors generated by a certain set of predictions. This can be used by any of
the regression functions. Typically the most common metrics to pull out are
the root mean squared errors in `rmse_all` or `rmse_average`.

## Data setup
[(Back to top)](#utilities)

A very basic function for generating a unique test set and non-unique training
datasets. This should only be used for simple testing. Some form of
cross-validation should be used in real applications.

## Database functions
[(Back to top)](#utilities)

A couple of database implementations that can be used to efficiently store
feature space representations. Should generally always use the `FingerprintDB`
function as the other is generally too simplistic.

## Data cleaning
[(Back to top)](#utilities)

Some functions to clean data are available.

*   Remove outliers based on targets.
*   Remove invariant features.
*   Remove features with e.g. NaN.

## General utilities
[(Back to top)](#utilities)

More generally useful functions.

*   A simplified implementation of the learning curve.
*   Jacobs geometry hash method.
