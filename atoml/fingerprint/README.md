# Fingerprint setup

The folder contains functions for generating a feature space from ASE atoms
objects. Initially one must initialize a class to generate the desired
features. A feature space based on the sorted eigenspectrum of the Coulomb
matrix, can be generated by the `StandardFingerprint` class.

  ```python
    sfp = StandardFingerprintGenerator()
  ```

The feature generation is handled by some setup functions. Once the class has
been initialized, it is then possible to call any of the generator functions
associated with it.

  ```python
    features = return_fpv(atoms, sfp.eigenspectrum_fpv)
  ```

Instead of passing a single function, it is also possible to pass a list of
generators:

  ```python
    pfp = ParticleFingerprintGenerator()

    features = return_fpv(atoms, [pfp.bond_count_fpv,
                                  sfp.eigenspectrum_fpv,
                                  sfp.composition_fpv])
  ```

It is even possible to pass user defined functions in as well. There should
just take the atoms objects being passed to `return_fpv` and return a list.

  ```python
    def f(atoms):
        return [1., len(atoms), random.random()]

    features = return_fpv(atoms, f)
  ```
