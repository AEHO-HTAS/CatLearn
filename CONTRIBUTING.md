*   Code should support Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5 (support for 2.6 will be
    dropped soon).

*   Code should adhere to the [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
    and [pyflakes](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes) style guides.

*   When new functions are added, tests should be written and added to the CI
    script.
