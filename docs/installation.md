Installation
============

The easiest way to install CatLearn is with:

```shell
$ pip install catlearn
```

This will automatically install the code as well as the dependencies. Alternatively, you can clone the repository to a local directory with:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/SUNCAT-Center/CatLearn.git
```

And then put the `<install_dir>/` into your `$PYTHONPATH` environment variable.

Be sure to install dependencies in with:

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
