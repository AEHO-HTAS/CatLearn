AtoML
==================================

Utilities for building and testing atomic machine learning models.

Requirements
------------

*   [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) (Atomic Simulation Environment)

Installation
------------

Put the `<install_dir>/` into your $PYTHONPATH environment variable

Atomic Simulation Environment
-----------------------------

ASE is a set of tools and Python modules for setting up, manipulating,
running, visualizing and analyzing atomistic simulations. Installation
instructions and tutorials can be found on their webpage
<https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/>.

ASAP - As Soon As Possible
--------------------------
If a large amount of testing is likely to be performed it is recommended that
ASAP is installed to replace the empirical potentials distributed with ASE. The
ASAP potentials are significantly more computationally efficient.
Installation instructions and tutorials can be found on their webpage
<https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/asap>.
