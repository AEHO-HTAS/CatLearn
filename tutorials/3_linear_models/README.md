# Linear models

This tutorial is intended to give further intuition for Gaussian processes.

Like in tutorial 1, we set up a known underlying function, generate training
and test data and calculate predictions and errors. We will compare the results
of linear ridge regression, Gaussian linear kernel regression and finally a
Gaussian process with the usual squared exponential kernel.
